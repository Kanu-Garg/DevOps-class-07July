# docker images

# docker ps -a


Deleting all containers:

$ docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)

Deleting all images:

$ docker system prune --all


Scenario 1: Port forwarding / Port Binding
********************

Once a container si created, you can access it from host machine

or

IF THE CONTAINER IS OF TYPE WEB APPLICATION

you can access the application of the container from the browser of your laptop

***** This scenario is not application to Images of type OS, DB

This scenario of Port forwarding / Port Binding works for Images which have web application


Port forwarding / Port Binding ==> it is applied only when creating the container

Once the container is created you cannot map a port

Here you have to give 2 posts for mapping

1. system port : any free port on EC2 

2. Container port : port exposed on the image--> you cannot change this if it is docker base image

For mapping , your will use run command and the option will be 

-p systemport:cotainerport

$  docker run -d --name n2 -p 8082:80 nginx


-P : docker will assign system port and container port. we dont do any port mapping

$ docker run -d --name n3 -P nginx


*****************

Scenario 2:


Once the container is running, you can acess its application page from the host

Step 1:

$ docker exec -it contianerName bash

For nginx container the location for application page is going to be 

/usr/share/nginx/html

$ cd /usr/share/nginx/html

$ ls

you will find index.html, chnage the content of this file

$ echo "this is new file" > index.html

$ exit

Access the container from browser, you new application willbe available
**************************

Docker Volumes:

*************************

1. How to create a volume

2. Attach the volume to the container directory whose data has to be preserved

3. Delete the container and check if data is preserved in the volume ot not

4. Can containers share the data ?
